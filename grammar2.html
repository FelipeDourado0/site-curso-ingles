    <h1>  Adjectives ending in '-ed' and '-ing' </h1>

    <h1>  Grammar explanation  </h1>   
    
    <h4>Adjectives that end in -ed (e.g. bored, interested) and adjectives
        that end in -ing (e.g. boring, interesting) are often confused.</h4>

   <br><br>

    <h2>-ed adjectives</h2>     

    <h4>Adjectives that end in -ed generally describe emotions – they tell us how people feel.</h4>

    <br><br>    

    <ol>
    
        <h4>  <li> I was so bored in that lesson, I almost fell asleep.  </li>   </h4> 
        <h4>  <li> He was surprised to see Helen after all those years.  </li>   </h4>  
        <h4>  <li> She was really tired and went to bed early.           </li>   </h4>  
    
    </ol>

    <br><br>  

   <h2>-ing adjectives</h2>

   <br><br>  

    <h4> Adjectives that end in -ing generally describe the thing that causes the emotion – a boring 
         lesson makes you feel bored.  </h4>    
    
    <br><br>    

         <ol>
         
             <h4>  <li>  Have you seen that film? It's really frightening.      </li>  </h4>  
             <h4>  <li>  I could listen to her for hours. She's so interesting. </li>  </h4>
             <h4>  <li>   I can't sleep! That noise is really annoying!         </li>  </h4>
         
         </ol>     

         <br><br>
