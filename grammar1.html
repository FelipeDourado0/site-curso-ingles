    <h1>  Adjectives and prepositions  </h1>

    <h4>  Do you know how to use adjectives with prepositions like interested in or similar to? <h4> 

    <h4>  Look at these examples to see how adjectives are used with prepositions. <h4> 
    
        <ol>
    
            <li>I'm interested in the idea.</li>
            <li>My jacket is similar to yours.</li>
            <li>My neighbour is angry about the party.</li>
        
        </ol>

    <h1>  Grammar explanation  </h1>   
    
    <h4>Some adjectives go with certain prepositions. There are no grammatical rules for which preposition is
    used with which adjective, so it's a good idea to try to learn them together. To help you do this, write 
    new vocabulary in your notebook in a sentence or phrase.</h4>

    <h4>However, there are some patterns that can help you. Let's look at them first. Remember that a</h4> 
    <h4>preposition is followed by a noun or a gerund (-ing form).</h4>

    <h2>With at</h2>     

    <h4>We use at with adjectives like good/bad/amazing/brilliant/terrible, etc.to talk about 
        skills and abilities.</h4>

        <table>
        
            <tr>
                <th rowspan="3"> AT </th>
                <td>He's really good at English.</td>  
            </tr>
            
            <tr>
                <td>She's amazing at the piano.</td>   
            </tr>
    
            <tr>
                <td>They're terrible at organising anything.</td>   
            </tr>

    <h2>With about </h2>     

    <h4>We often use about with adjectives of feelings like angry/excited/happy/nervous/sad/stressed/worried, 
        etc. to explain what is causing that feeling. </h4>

        <table>
        
            <tr>
                <th rowspan="3"> ABOUT </th>
                <td>I'm angry about the decision.</td>  
            </tr>
            
            <tr>
                <td>He's nervous about the presentation.  </td>   
            </tr>
    
            <tr>
                <td>She's excited about the new job.  </td>   
            </tr>
