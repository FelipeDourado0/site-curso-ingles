    <h1>  Grammar explanation  </h1>   
    
    <h4>Here are some of the most important things to know about using articles.</h4>

    <h1>Jobs</h1>
    
    <br> 
    
    <h4>  When we say what people's jobs are, we usually use a/an.  </h4>

   <br>
       
        <table>
        
            <tr>
                <th rowspan="3"> A / AN </th>
                <td>He's an architect.  </td>  
            </tr>
            
            <tr>
                <td> She's a scientist.  </td>   
            </tr>
    
            <tr>
                <td> My grandmother was a teacher. </td>   
            </tr>
    
        </table>

    <h1>  Singular nouns  </h1> 
    
    <h4> Singular, countable nouns always have an article – a/an or the (or another determiner – my, your, 
        this, that, etc.).  </h4>>

    
    
    <h4> We use a/an – the indefinite article – when we talk about something for the first time, or something that
         is part of a group or type.  </h4>>


    <ul>
    
        <h4>  <li> I saw a good film yesterday. </li>  </h4>
        <h4>  <li> Do you want a drink?         </li>  </h4>
         
    </ul>    

    <br>

    <h4> We use a when the word that follows it begins with a consonant sound. We use an when it's followed
         by a vowel sound. This makes pronunciation easier. </h4>>

    <br>
    
    <ul>
    
        <h4>  <li> She has a university degree.  </li>  </h4>
        <h4>  <li> It took me an hour to get home. </li>  </h4>
         
    </ul>    

    <br>

    <h4> We use the – the definite article – when the listener already knows which thing we are talking about 
        because it was mentioned before or because there's only one of them. </h4>>

    <br>
    
    <ul>
    
        <h4>  <li> I'm going to take the dog for a walk. </li>  </h4>
        <h4>  <li> Have you seen the car key? </li>  </h4>
         
    </ul>    

    <br>

    <h1>  Things in general </h1> 

    <br>

    <h4> When we talk about things in general, we normally use a plural or uncountable noun with no article. </h4>>

    <br>

    <ul>
    
        <h4>  <li>   Birds eat worms.      </li>  </h4>
        <h4>  <li>   Water freezes at 0°C. </li>  </h4>
         
    </ul>    

    <br>

    <h1>  Particular groups of things </h1> 

    <br>

    <h4> When we talk about a particular group of things, we use the. </h4>>

    <br>

    <ul>
    
        <h4>  <li>    We went to the zoo and saw the kangaroos. (These are the particular kangaroos in that zoo 
                      – not kangaroos in general.)    </li>  </h4>
       
    </ul>
